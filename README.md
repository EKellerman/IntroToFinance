#     Venmo

##  Overview

Venmo was founded in 2009 by two friends, Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail  who were inspired to find an easier and more convenient way to pay each other back and splitting bills for dinner, rent, tickets etc. Kortina and Magon-Ismail were at a concert when the idea sparked in  sending money to other people using just their mobile phone because they were too lazy to get downstairs from the balcony to tip the local band. The inspiration of the concept in connecting mobile payments with a phone app that is connected to the user’s bank account is when Magdon-Ismail visited Kotrina in New York from Philadelphia and forgot his wallet at home. In 2009, the  founders started the company as a text message-based payment delivery system. By 2012, Venmo launched a platform with an integrated social network to capitalize in P2P economy. In 2012, Venmo sold to Baintree, a mobile system payment company, for $26 million. In 2013, PayPal bought Baintree and Venmo for $800 million. 

Venmo make money through credit card fees and merchant fees. When a Venmo user uses a debit card, linked to a bank account or their Venmo balance, there is no transaction fees. When a user pay with a credit card, Venmo charges 3% of the total value of the transaction. Venmo collects most of its revenue from the per-transaction fees it charges its two million merchants. With the increase competition in digital payment sector like Apple Pay and Google Pay, the company released the Venmo debit card, which draws directly from a user’s Venmo balance. The debit card operates through Mastercard and users can use it at any merchant that accepts Mastercard. Venmo charges merchants a 3% fee plus $0.30 per transaction.

## Business Activities
Most Venmo users are the Millennial shoppers and Generation Z who will likely to shop from their phone . Three in four Millennials have used mobile person-to-person payments. While Venmo’s target audience are the Millennials and  Generation Z , it has also become popular with Generation X and  Baby Boomers. Generation Z demographics show the largest user group of mobile payment users and are more likely than older consumer segments to use technological payment that allows them to split payment with friends. About 90 percent of millennials own smartphones, and 50 percent have used their mobile device to make a purchase. (Gramigna, 2016). 
Unlike its competitors, Venmo doesn’t charge fees to users in sending or receiving money. Venmo users can also send payments even having insufficient balance on their Venmo account because the deficit amounts are retrieved from a primary funding source connected to their bank account, debit card, or a credit card.

## Landscape
Venmo is a peer-to-peer (P2P) payment application that has recently grown popularity in the financial technology industry. Venmo promotes digital payments within a social network of friends. Venmo has dominated the peer-to-peer money transfer market through a mobile platform with digital transfer mechanism and social network nature.
Before Venmo, customers’ other options that are not as quick and convenient were to travel to the bank to withdraw from ATM or write a check. Today, Venmo has revolutionized the digital technologies in a transformative and beneficial way by making money transfer between individuals quick and an easy exchange. To ensure users account safety, Venmo uses bank-grade security and encryption and users create a PIN code  to further enhance account security. The “Nearby Payment” function facilitates payments to individuals outside a user’s friend group if they are in nearby proximity. The “trust” feature lets customers use the auto-pay function for recurring expenses. 
Venmo has several competitors in the mobile-payment industry that have similar functionalities. Some of its top competitors are Zelle, Apple Pay, Square Cash, Google Pay, Square Cash, and Facebook Messenger. Zelle has the most similar features as Venmo and might be their biggest competitor. 

## Results
In 2019, the company reported that there are 40 million yearly active users. Venmo payments volume grew 73% year-over-year in the first quarter to $21billion and is on pace to do $100 billion in payment volume and $300 million in revenue. (Rosenbaum, 2019). Venmo’s convenient and fast peer-to-peer payment application continue to gain popularity because of its fee structure of not charging users transaction, monthly or annual fees. Venmo generates income through the 3%  credit card and merchant fees. Venmo has partnered with Uber, UberEATS, Grubhub, Chipotle and other merchants in which will bring in additional revenue. Like Venmo, Zelle offers split payments and transfers with no transaction fees to users with bank account. Zelle was created by a group of U.S. bank to create their own money transfer app. There are 924 partner financial institutions including giant banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo and J.P Morgan.  The  company facilitated $187 billion network volumes and 519 million transactions. (Zelle, n.d.).

## Recommendations
If I were to advise the company, I would recommend to expand internationally. Most of Venmo’s consumers are the millennials and a growing popularity in younger generations. Many of these target consumers like to travel, convenience and prefer mobile payment applications. This will bring more customers and revenue worldwide. To expand internationally, the company will also need to allow international bank account transactions. Additional recommendations is to grow into  method of business to consumer payment. Growing into a major B2C payment should be an easier transition by using similar technologies use by its parent company, PayPal.
